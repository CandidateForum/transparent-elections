# Transparent Elections

## Objective for the Project

This project will allow Elections Commissions in any Jurisdiction to create a Candidate Forum web site to which Candidates can upload videos in which they explain their positions on key issues.<br>
<br>
We will be building open source software that will install everything needed for the commission to build and maintain the Forum on it's own servers.

## Status of the Project

At this point, we do not have the skills needed to create the software, and are looking for contributors.<br>
<br>
If you have good web development skills, please contact the team leader.<br>
<br>
Thank You.
