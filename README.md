## Transparent Elections

### Objective for the Project

Elections in most of the world today are full of misinformation and personal attacks, which hide the importance of the actual issues faced by the electorate.  
We would like to helpt correct this.<br>
<br>
The objective is to create web sites designed so that Candidates can upload videos in which they explain their positions on key issues,
free from lies, spin, and pure negativity.<br>
<br>
This project will create software that will allow elections commissions in any jurisdiction to create such a web site.<br>
<br>
For more information on the concept, please visit www.candidateforum.us.<br>
<br>
Our open source software will install everything needed for the commission to build and maintain the Forum on it's own servers.

### Status of the Project

At this point, we do not have the skills needed to create the software, and are looking for contributors.<br>
<br>
If you have good web development skills, please contact the team leader.<br>
<br>
Thank You.
